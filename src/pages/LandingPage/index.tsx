            Ideas are these disembodied life forms, they don't have a form, but
            they have a will. All they want is to be made manifest. If you can
            manage to open up your consciousness to an idea of living in a world
            of abundance, then you can believe that, constantly, ideas are
            trying to find human collaborators.
